This dataset is a manually created "phantom" that can be used to test correctness of the implementation of bit packing procedures of the implementation. The frame size of this 3-slice dataset is 23x38, which is not divisible by 8, causing the bit-packed representation of the frame not aligning with the byte boundary. The middle slice of the image should show a round region, and the pixels toggled in the segmentation should match those in the image. Segmentation also has pixels toggled in 4 corners of each of the 3 slices.
